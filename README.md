ProtonMail, with its strong focus on privacy and security, is widely used by individuals and organizations that value encrypted communications. Using this phishlet, organizations can assess the effectiveness of their phishing defense mechanisms and discover potential vulnerabilities, especially in MFA systems.

## Setting Up Evilginx with the ProtonMail Phishlet
